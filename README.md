# Visions to Visuals Chatbot API
This project aims to expand the products and services offered by Visions to Visuals by creating a high quality and affordable AI powered chatbot that can be provided as a paid service.  The Chatbot's key purpose is to provide clients with a system they can integrate onto their sites with minimal configuration (under 15 minutes) that will be able to answer common user questions by referencing actual site content.  The idea is to create a chatbot that feels like a natural part of the site.
